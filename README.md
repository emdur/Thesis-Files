# Thesis-Files

This repository contains the Max/MSP Project files of the applications for the bachelor's thesis
"Interaktive Anwendungen zur algorithmischen Generierung von Schlagzeugmusik & Perspektiven f√ºr assistiertes Musizieren" by Isabella Kloska.

See what the applications look like:
If you click on one of the main folders, you will see two pictures.
One of them shows the User Interface (the main Max Patch) of the application in Presentation Mode, the other shows how it looks in Edit/Developer's Mode.

See the js files:
If you then click on the "...Raw_Files"-folder, there are the project file and two sub folders: "patchers" and "code".

The "code" folder contains the JavaScript/NodeJS files of the application.
The manually written, relevant files are:

magenta_interpolation.js (Experimant 1)
bjorklund.js (Experiment 2)
generate_euclidean_rhythm.js (Experiment 3)
magenta_tap.js (Experiment 3)

The "patchers" folder contains the Max/MSP patches, made with Max/MSPs graphical, node-based IDE.
You won't be able to open and see those if you don't have Max/MSP installed on your computer.
